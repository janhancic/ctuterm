# CTUterm
This will hopefully become my right hand that will help me accomplish common operations I perform on my computer. 
Inspired by the software they used in CTU in the [TV show 24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29).

## Status
Non existent at the moment. I'm still thinking about how it should work and look. I'm also learning how to use 
[node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) while I'm doing this.

## Development
If you want to start hacking on this execute this commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/janhancic/ctuterm.git
cd ctuterm
npm install
mv node_modules/nodewebkit/package.json node_modules/nodewebkit/_package.json # this is temporary until a bug is resolved
```

To start the app run `npm start`.
